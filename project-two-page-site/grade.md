### CSS
Search for `prof feedback` in individual files for specific comments.

### Responsive Design
Overall your design and layout are great!

However, there is some inconsistency in the width and alignment of different section content. Ideally all sections should have the same width of container, and the same padding on the left and right to ensure everything lines up perfectly.
  - The issue is coming from the fact that you have a `.container` inside another `.container` so the side padding is doubling up and affecting the alignment.

### Assignment Requirements
