Welcome to my School Projects Portfolio, where I showcase a collection of projects that I've completed during my diploma studies. These projects encompass a range of web development skills, particularly focusing on JS, React, HTML, CSS, and SASS.


## Project Highlights:

- **Media Player**
I designed and implemented a responsive media player using HTML, CSS, and SASS. This project showcases my understanding of styling, layout, and media handling, creating a seamless experience for users to interact with different types of media content.

- **Service Worker Integration**
I've delved into the world of service workers to improve the offline experience of web applications. I've developed a service worker that caches important assets, enabling users to access content even when offline

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
In this project, I built a Progressive Web App using React. By leveraging service workers and caching strategies, I've developed an app that delivers a reliable, fast, and engaging user experience, regardless of network conditions.

- **React Routing Application**
Through this project, I've learned to implement dynamic page navigation in a React application. By utilizing React Router, I've created a multi-page application with seamless transitions and efficient URL-based routing.

- **Cache Exercise**
Exploring caching techniques, I've developed a caching exercise that demonstrates my ability to manage and control cached resources. This project involves strategies for cache expiration, updating, and efficient storage utilization.

## Technologies Utilized:
- React.js
- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS
- Service Workers
- React Router

## Future Development:
My journey in web development is ongoing, and I'm eager to continue expanding my skill set.
